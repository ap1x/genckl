genckl
======

The genckl utility generates a STIG Viewer checklist (ckl) file based on one or more input files, which can be either STIG formatted zip, or xccdf formatted xml. If xccdf results are found in one of the input files, they are included in the output checklist. Optionally supports checklist templates and automatic host data collection.
